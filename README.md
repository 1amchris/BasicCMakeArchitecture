# BasicCMakeArchitecture

Cmake is a tool that might seem counter intuitive at first. I haven't found basic cmake architecture on the internet. This is why, I created this project as a basic entry point for creating small cmake projects. The them of this basic architecture is a chess game.

# Installation

The project depends on [CMake](https://cmake.org/install/), I recommand you to download the CMake gui. Once that this is done, you will also need to download this github project. If you are using the CMake gui, you should be able to specify the location of the source files. After that, you should also be able to specify the location of the build folder. This is where the generated files will end up. The last thing that you need to do is to specify the Configuration of the project. If you make to use Makefile, you can use them. If you have Visual Studio and that you want to generate a Solution, you can. If you are on Mac and that you want to generate and .xcode projects, you also can. The point of using CMake is to create a wrapper that will make a source code run on your computer.
